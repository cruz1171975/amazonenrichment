    "description": "Product Overview Ferric Chloride 40% is a high-purity, Reagent Grade aqueous solution of Iron(III) Chloride (FeCl₃). Also known as Iron Trichloride, this solution acts as a powerful oxidizing agent and Lewis acid, making it essential for industrial water treatment and electronics manufacturing. The solution is strictly formulated to maintain a typical iron content of 40% w/w, verified by ICP-OES analysis to ensure consistent performance across batches. Engineered for professional use, this product serves as a primary coagulant and flocculant in wastewater processing, effectively precipitating solids and removing impurities. In the electronics sector, it is the industry-standard etchant for printed circuit boards (PCBs) and photoengraving processes. Alliance Chemical supplies this Ferric Chloride solution in scalable packaging options ranging from 1-gallon bottles to 330-gallon totes, meeting the logistics requirements of both laboratory research and large-scale manufacturing facilities. Key Properties Chemical Name: Iron(III) Chloride Solution Formula: FeCl₃ Grade: Reagent CAS Number: 7705-08-0 Specific Gravity: 1.18–1.20 (Typical 1.19 at 20°C) Iron (Fe): ≤ 1,000 ppm (Typical 300 ppm) Appearance: Reddish-brown liquid Heavy Metals (as Pb): ≤ 2 ppm (Typical 0.5 ppm) Available Chlorine (as Cl₂): 0.5–2% (Typical 1.5%) Free Alkali (NaOH): 0.1–0.5% (Typical 0.2%) Residue After Ignition: ≤ 0.5% (Typical 0.2%) Chloride (Cl⁻): ≤ 700,000 ppm Sulfate (SO₄²⁻): ≤ 5,000 ppm Water Content: 0–60% (Typical 55%) Common Applications Water & Wastewater Treatment: Functions as a superior coagulant and flocculant to destabilize colloids, remove suspended solids, and reduce turbidity in industrial effluent and municipal water systems. PCB Fabrication & Etching: Used extensively in the electronics industry for the chemical milling and etching of copper on printed circuit boards, delivering precise line definition. Metal Surface Finishing: applied in surface preparation and etching of metals such as copper, brass, and stainless steel prior to coating or plating. Chemical Synthesis: Acts as a Lewis acid catalyst in organic synthesis reactions, including chlorination and Friedel-Crafts reactions. Pigment Manufacturing: Utilized as an intermediate precursor in the production of industrial pigments and dyes. Safety Precautions Ferric Chloride 40% is corrosive and must be handled with strict adherence to safety protocols. Personnel should utilize chemical-resistant PPE, including nitrile gloves, splash goggles, and protective aprons. Use only in well-ventilated areas to avoid inhalation of vapors. This solution reacts with metals to produce flammable hydrogen gas; ensure storage containers are made of corrosion-resistant materials like HDPE or glass. Store in a cool, dry environment away from direct sunlight and incompatible materials such as strong bases and oxidizing agents. In the event of skin or eye contact, rinse immediately with copious amounts of water for at least 15 minutes and seek medical attention. Refer to the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) for comprehensive handling, storage, and emergency procedures. Benefits High-Efficiency Coagulation – Rapidly settles suspended solids in water treatment applications, improving filtration rates. Precision Etching – Provides consistent etch rates for electronics and metalworking, reducing rework and material waste. Reagent Grade Purity – Strict control of trace metals and impurities ensures compatibility with sensitive chemical processes.",
